"Welcome to Travel Bliss! We believe planning a trip shouldn't feel like solving a Rubik's Cube. Our platform is built to help you explore dreamy destinations, book seamless journeys, and uncover hidden gems—all without breaking a sweat (or the bank)."


2-
Home.jsx:

Experience Section: Updated content to reflect our achievements:
"We've packed countless bags, ticked off over 2,000 happy travelers, and racked up a whopping 15,000 unforgettable moments—all in just 3 years! Not bad for a team that still occasionally forgets sunscreen."
